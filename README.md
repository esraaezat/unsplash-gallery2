I utilized Unsplash API to dynamically fetch and display images, implemented pagination for better user experience, and added interactivity using dynamic HTML and JavaScript. Additionally, I designed a responsive carousel and styled the entire website using CSS to bring the project to life.
you can scroll easily in the website if you like an image you can download it or close it
